Molecular databases downloaded November 2017
Downloaded by Ricardo da Silva (UC San Diego, USA) and Justin van der Hooft (Wageningen UR, NL)

All molecular identifiers and available structural information was downloaded from their respective websites.
Data files were formatted individually using pandas and rdkit to add chemical information and partly classified by ClassyFire (https://jcheminf.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-016-0174-y) to accomodate use for Network Annotation Propagation (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29668671).

HMDB, YMDB, and DrugBank were added as they contain natural molecules (HMDB, YMDB) as well as often natural product derived molecules (DrugBank).

Note that the NPASS download was interrupted several times and currently a partial [incomplete] set is available. 
StreptomycesDB2 is available in sdf format and not further formatted or classified.

The substructure database was downloaded as the SI from Ertl 2017 (https://jcheminf.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-017-0225-z) who describes functional groups present in CheBi.
